# The Baby Saver

### The Problem
Each your an average of 37 infants will die in just the United States because they are left in a car. This is a particular problem in Florida with temperatures often above 90 degrees which can be lethal for a baby. The main purpouse of this project is to help save the lives of infants, however its application does not end there. It can also be applied to most anything that someone may leave in a car.

### Our solution
Our soultion involves using an arduino with various sensors and an android phone to provide potentially lifesaving data to a user. The arduino when started will begin listening for a car door to shut. When it recognizes a sound loud enough to be a car door it will then check to see if a button is pressed meaning that there is pressure on the top of the enclosure. This changes a data value that an android phone can read and then update it's display to reflect the current state of the package or in most cases child carrier. It also contains a heat sensor that will trigger an alarm if the temperature gets to hot for a child. Another life saving aspect is that the app when disconecting will be able to check the last known value and see whether or not you are walking away from your child or other cargo.
